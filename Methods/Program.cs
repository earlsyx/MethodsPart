//Methods
// encapsulating code- putting code in 1 spot.
// calling this code in just one line
// allows to reuse our code, 
// call our code more than once
// keeps code simpler ,and cleaner and easier to read.

// pass data into them
// get method data out of them
// gets lots of data out of them

//best practices, DRY - Don't repeat yourself.

Console.WriteLine();
// use over and over again
// call method all code in the method is excuted in one line.
