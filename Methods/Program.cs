//Methods
// encapsulating code- putting code in 1 spot.
// calling this code in just one line
// allows to reuse our code, 
// call our code more than once
// keeps code simpler ,and cleaner and easier to read.

// pass data into them
// get method data out of them
// gets lots of data out of them

//best practices, DRY - Don't repeat yourself.

//using statement, shortcut,
//text shrotcut.
//ambigious name, ambiguous call. cause problem
using Methods;

// use over and over again
// call method all code in the method is excuted in one line.

//SampleMethods.SayHi();

//if can reduce dont lol
//for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
//{
//    SampleMethods.SayHi();
//}
ConsoleMessages.SayHi();

Console.WriteLine("This is Tim");
ConsoleMessages.SayHi();
//code repitition.

//naming is critical, name things for what they do.
// not describe what method it has.
//tells method job
